# Ralph

Ralph is a set of automation/utility scripts I've written in python and that I
use in my daily life.

## Description

### Email Reminder

It's a quick and dirty script that sends me an email to remind me login to the
job centre's dashboard and update my info.

I have a cron job that's scheduled to run the script every month on the 28th.
